# HPDB Data

Genome database used in HPDB, consists of `133` strains of Helicobacter Pylori. The list of strain is stored in `strains_list.csv`.

Each genome consists of:
- Complete genome in FASTA format (downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/169))
- Annotation result by [RAST](http://rast.nmpdr.org)

Automatic scripts used to process those files are also included without document.
